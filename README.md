# Classification_Churn_with_Parsnip

Modelling with Tidymodels and Parsnip - A Tidy Approach to a Classification Problem

# I am using R tidymodels to create and execute a “tidy” modelling workflow to tackle a classification problem. 
# My aim is to show how easy it is to fit a simple logistic regression in R’s glm and quickly switch to a cross-validated random forest using the ranger engine by changing only a few lines of code
